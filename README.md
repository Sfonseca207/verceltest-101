This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) font family, a new font provided by Vercel.
